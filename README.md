# benchme

Hosted demo applications, MCP servers and (soon) a verifier for agentic
benchmarks. A fictional industrial-supply company whose apps agents use as
*users*: sign up, log in, read and change data through web UIs, REST and MCP.

Every run gets its own **workspace**: an isolated, deterministically seeded
copy of the data (`scenario` + `seed`), scoped on every row, so parallel runs
never see each other and two runs with the same seed start from byte-identical
state.

```
POST /api/workspaces        {"scenario":"acme-v1","seed":4242}   → urls for every app
/w/<id>/warehouse/          products, stock, orders, transfers (UI · /api/v1 · /mcp)
/w/<id>/helpdesk/           tickets, comments, SLAs (UI · /api/v1 · /mcp)
/w/<id>/vaultdocs/          the document vault (UI · /api/v1 · /mcp with resources + prompts)
/w/<id>/verify/v1/submit/<taskId>   POST an artifact → verdict + receipt
/w/<id>/mail/               the workspace inbox (verification codes land here)
/data/                      the company site (static, generated from the seed)
POST /api/workspaces/<id>/finalize                               → a signed receipt
```

## Layout

| path | what |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core` | config, http (healthz/readyz), ids, receipts (HMAC), pg + migrations, redis, the workspace model |
| `packages/scenarios` | seeded generators (`acme-v1`) and the derived ground truths |
| `apps/gateway` | workspace API, signed reverse proxy, portal + MCP registry, reaper |
| `packages/site-kit` | what every site shares: the gateway-scope hook, signup/verify/login + sessions + api tokens, the MCP server plumbing, the page shell |
| `apps/warehouse` | products, stock, orders, transfers: SSR UI, REST v1, a 14-tool MCP server |
| `apps/helpdesk` | tickets, comments, SLAs, assignment: SSR UI, REST v1, an 11-tool MCP server (with a destructive `delete_ticket`) |
| `apps/vaultdocs` | ~40 seeded documents as MCP **resources** (`docs://<id>`), `search`/`get_document`/`list_documents` tools, two MCP **prompts**; full-text search UI + REST |
| `apps/verify` | the verifier: json / xlsx / docx / patch oracles, HMAC receipts, attempt log, isolated Kubernetes Job runner |
| `apps/mail` | per-workspace inbox with an internal delivery endpoint |
| `apps/data` | the generated company site |
| `charts/benchme` | the Helm chart: own postgres + redis, apps, migrate job, reaper, ingress |
| `docker/app.Dockerfile` | one multi-stage Dockerfile, `--build-arg APP=<app>` |

## Develop

```bash
npm ci
docker run -d --name benchme-pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=benchme -e POSTGRES_USER=benchme -e POSTGRES_DB=benchme -p 15432:5432 postgres:16
DATABASE_URL=postgres://benchme:benchme@127.0.0.1:15432/benchme npm test   # real Postgres, no mocks
npx tsc -b tsconfig.build.json
```

## Run it on your machine

Everything — Postgres, Redis, the migrations, the gateway, the sites, the
verifier and the reaper — comes up with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d                 # images from ghcr.io/orabenchmarks at BENCHME_VERSION
open http://localhost:8080           # the portal; POST /api/workspaces to mint a workspace
docker compose down -v               # stop and drop the database volume
```

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to change the port, the public URL or the
  secrets (every value has a local default; change every secret before
  exposing this beyond your machine).
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d --build` builds
  the images from this checkout instead of pulling them.
- Task specs live in `compose/specs/` (two smoke specs ship;
  see its README to add your own).
- **Code tasks and the Docker socket.** The verifier runs each submitted
  patch in a sibling container: no network, capabilities dropped,
  memory/CPU/pid limits, a hard deadline, removed afterwards — the local
  counterpart of the Kubernetes Job runner. That needs `/var/run/docker.sock`
  mounted into the verifier, which gives that container control of your
  Docker daemon. On Linux set `DOCKER_GID` in `.env` to the socket's group
  (`stat -c %g /var/run/docker.sock`); Docker Desktop works with the default.
  To refuse the socket, set `RUNNER_KIND=none` and remove the socket volume
  from `compose.yaml`: code tasks then fail with a note and every other oracle
  keeps working.

## Release

Tag `vX.Y.Z`: the `images` workflow pushes `ghcr.io/orabenchmarks/<app>:X.Y.Z`
and the `chart` workflow pushes `oci://ghcr.io/orabenchmarks/charts/benchme:X.Y.Z`.
Packages are public so clusters pull anonymously; the source stays private
until publication.

```bash
helm install benchme oci://ghcr.io/orabenchmarks/charts/benchme --version X.Y.Z -n benchme --create-namespace \
  --set ingress.host=benchme.example.test --set publicBaseUrl=http://benchme.example.test
```

### GitOps deployments (ArgoCD and friends)

Two chart inputs cannot travel through `helm template`:

- **Secrets.** By default the chart generates its five secrets on first
  install and keeps them with a `lookup` — a rendering that has no cluster
  (ArgoCD's repo-server) would mint new values on every sync and rotate the
  Postgres password. Provide a Secret yourself (an ExternalSecret from your
  secret manager, keys `gatewaySecret`, `operatorKey`, `receiptSecret`,
  `mailInternalSecret`, `postgresPassword`) and name it in
  `secrets.existingSecret`.
- **Hidden task specs.** Never commit them. Build a ConfigMap from your
  hidden-tasks checkout and apply it out-of-band, then name it in
  `verify.existingSpecsConfigMap` (the chart renders no specs ConfigMap of its
  own and mounts yours at `/specs`):

  ```bash
  node tools/build-specs.mjs --hidden ../benchme-hidden \
    --configmap benchme-task-specs-hidden --namespace benchme --out specs-cm.yaml
  kubectl -n benchme apply -f specs-cm.yaml     # re-run after every hidden-tasks change
  ```
